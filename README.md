# Face Generation

## Introduction
In this project, you'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.


## Getting the project files
The project files can be found in our [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/), in the project-face-generation folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/
```

Since we need GPU support in this project, so we decided to complete our project using the provided, in-classroom project notebook; this will just require that we run the project notebook, and download the complete files later on.

## Structure of Project
dlnd_face_generation.ipynb: Notebook of the project
problem_unittests.py: Test file for different TODO functions in the project
